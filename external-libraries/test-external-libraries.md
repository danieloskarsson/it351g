# Dugga: External libraries

Fork https://github.com/a97marbr/XXX and clone your Github repository to your computer. Work locally and make commits often. In this test you should:

* [ ] Choose a external library \(any library, except Picasso, accessible using Gradle\)
* [ ] Modify build.gradle to make the library API available
* [ ] Use the library from your app's source code so that the result of it's usage can be seen from within the app

Submit the URL and a release-build of the APK.
