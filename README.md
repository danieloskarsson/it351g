# Course introduction

### Classes

There are 24 classes and an equal amount of supervised sessions. 14 of those classes start with a lecture that lasts ~30-90 minutes. The last two weeks of the course ends with a project seminar followed by a home exam the following week. All classes are listed in TimeEdit. &lt;insert link&gt;.

### Examinations

There are four examination parts to this course. The first two are tests \(sv. duggor\), the third is an individual project and the last one is a home exam. To get VG in the course you need to complete all tests and get VG on the project and the home exam.

### Tests

There are eights tests \(sv. duggor\) of which six \(6\) are mandatory for G and the last two \(2\) are mandatory for being eligible for VG. Tests are due on Fridays at 5 pm. There is one test due for the next eight weeks, starting this week. The tests directly corresponds what we will go through in class, so those that take advantage of the lectures and supervised classes are well positioned to pass the tests.
